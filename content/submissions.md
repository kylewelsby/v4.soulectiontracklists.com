Remix Details: 

We have teamed up with the incomparable Rose Gold to create an opportunity for any producer in our community to be a part of an official Soulection remix project for her latest single “Addicted”.
 
The rules are simple.

Download the stems for the original song, make a remix, send us the full song and your info via the submission link by 11.01.2022 to be considered. 

Our favorite remixes will become an official remix EP that will be released digitally and physically (vinyl), the rest will live on a private playlist for everyone to enjoy. 

Producers will be included on all earnings according to the type of remix they make (50% if you compose all new music under the acapella, 25% if you use the music stems in any way), and will have their remixes played on Soulection Radio. 


Feel free to post the audio or video snippet to socials and tag #ADDICTEDREMIX
