In celebration of Rose Gold's recent releases, Soulection wants to invite producers from the community to create remixes of her song “Addicted”.

Musicians must use the stems provided to create their own original remix.

If selected by the host, you will receive the opportunity to be the opening act at one stop of Nick & Knight's upcoming tour, a feature on their upcoming album, social media exposure and $500.
